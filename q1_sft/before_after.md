### Test 2: Polite Request

**Prompt:** "Please explain what photosynthesis is"

**Before (Base Model):**
> Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose (a type of sugar). This chemical energy is stored in the form of plant cells, which can be used for growth, reproduction, and other processes.
> 
> Photosynthesis occurs in two stages: the light-dependent reactions (LDR) and the light-independent reactions (LID). The LDR involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy in the form of a molecule called carrier molecule (CO2). This molecule is then transported through the plant cell to the stomata, where it enters the ch

**After (Fine-tuned):**
>Photosynthesis is a process that converts light energy from sunlight into chemical energy, which can then be used by plants, algae, and other organisms for growth, energy storage, and survival. In simple terms, photosynthesis is the process by which plants and algae convert inorganic matter (such as carbon dioxide and water) into organic matter (such as glucose and oxygen) through the process of energy capture and storage.

Photosynthesis involves the following steps:

1. Light energy: Light energy is absorbed by chloroplasts in the leaves and other green tissues of plants and algae.

2. Carbon dioxide: ...
